# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for Dinner? The ultimate question. This simple webpage is for those indecisive folks out there who can't easily decide on what to eat for their next meal.

This version of What's for Dinner provides two opportunities for user interaction. The first is an application that pulls a randomly generated side dish, main dish, or dessert from a pre-determined list of recipes. One click, and voila! It'll be Steak and potatoes for dinner tonight.

If a user wants to provide their own recipe lists, or edit/delete the pre-loaded selections, they can do so! Head on over to the "View all Recipes" page and edit, add, and delete to your heart's content. Then, head back to the "Pick my Meal" page to randomly pull from your newly created lists.
